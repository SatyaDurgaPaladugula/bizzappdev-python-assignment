# bizzappdev-python-assignment
This repository reflects my ability to solve real-world problems using Python with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and structured thinking. Each solution demonstrates:

Strong problem-solving and algorithmic skills

Clean, well-documented, and readable code

Proper handling of edge cases and constraints

Attention to performance optimization

Commitment to professional coding standards expected in a development role

I’ve treated this assignment like a real development task—prioritizing quality, structure, and attention to detail. I am excited about the opportunity to bring this same approach to your team at BizzAppDev Systems Pvt. Ltd.
